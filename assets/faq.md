# The Goalkeeper FAQ

## About MEL your AI Coach

### What is this Performance Coaching AI?
Our AI chatbot (MEL) is a personalized performance and growth coach designed to help you unlock your full potential. By combining advanced AI technology with insights from neuroscience and growth mindset research, MEL provides tailored guidance to support your personal and professional development.

### How is MEL different from other coaching tools?
Unlike generic coaching apps, our chatbot:
- Learns from your unique interactions and progress
- Grounds recommendations in scientific research from neuroscience experts
- Provides personalized, adaptive coaching strategies
- Maintains a comprehensive, evolving understanding of your growth journey

### Is MEL a replacement for human coaches?
No, our AI is a complementary tool designed to support your personal development. It provides insights, strategies, and motivation, but should not be considered a substitute for professional mental health or career counseling when more intensive support is needed.

## How MEL Works

### How MEL remembers and learns from your interactions?
MEL uses a sophisticated graph database to create a dynamic knowledge graph of your personal development journey. This allows the chatbot to:
- Track your goals and progress
- Understand your unique challenges and strengths
- Provide increasingly personalized recommendations over time

### What is the source of the MEL's knowledge?
Our MEL is trained on transcripts from leading YouTube channels and research papers focused on neuroscience, psychology, and personal growth. This ensures that recommendations are grounded in current scientific understanding of human potential and development.

### How private and secure are my interactions?
- All personal data is encrypted
- Interactions are anonymized
- We do not sell or share your personal information
- You can delete your interaction history at any time using "Lobotomize Me" on the memory tab.

### Is my data shared with third parties?
- Third Parties provide the following service to enable the Goalkeeper:
1. Cloud storage services.  
2. Inference from frontier large language models.
3. Web service hosting and deployment services.

All data shared with these providers is encrypted both in transit and at rest.  We use an inference supplier whose sole business model is providing inference and does not store, sell or use any data shared to further their models.  No data is stored in by the web service hosting platform.    

### Why do you require a google login?
We use Google's OAuth 2.0 (OpenID) authentication service.  This allows us to offload a significant amount of authentication management so we can focus on providing you with the best experience. This provides us with access to a your Google email address associated with the OpenID but we will never use this address without proper authorization. Your email address is not shared with any third parties.

## Technical Details

### What technologies power this chatbot?
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) with natural language processing
- A graph database for dynamic knowledge mapping
- Curated neuroscience and psychology research transcripts
- Advanced machine learning algorithms

### Why does MEL respond slower than other chatbots I've used?
MEL is trained to follow a structured approach to responding to each prompt received.  
- MEL reviews the prompt provided  
- Searches its memory to retrieve previous information shared with respect to the prompt  
- Searches additional information if necessary to help respond to the prompt.  
- Creates its response  
- Stores both the prompt and response in the knowledge graph.  
- Responds to the prompt.  
Traditional AI chatbots just pass the prompt to the LLM and repeats the response.
