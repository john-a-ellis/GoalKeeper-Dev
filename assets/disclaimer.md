## The GoalKeeper (version 0.1.0)

is an AI-powered application featuring the performance coach *MEL* (a Mindset-oriented, Eidetic, Librarian). The Goalkeeper leverages a large language model (LLM) that accesses a vast collection of curated YouTube transcripts featuring discussions with world-renowned experts in goal achievement and a series of prompts to create *MEL*. Both *MEL* and the transcript cache are grounded in neuroscience and the growth mindset. As you interact with *MEL*, it builds a "memory" of your conversations, enabling it to provide more personalized and effective responses to your future queries. This way, *MEL* becomes more attuned to your specific needs and can better assist you in achieving your goals. You can view this memory by clicking on the "Entity Memory Graph" button
