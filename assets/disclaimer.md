## The GoalKeeper (version 0.1.0)

The GoalKeeper is an AI-powered app featuring a performance coach named **MEL** (Mindset-oriented, Eidetic, Librarian). It uses a large language model (LLM) to access a cache of YouTube transcripts of interviews with experts in goal achievement. **MEL** and the transcript cache are grounded in neuroscience and the growth mindset. As you chat with **MEL**, it builds a memory of your conversations to provide more personalized and effective responses. You can view this memory via the "Entity Memory Graph" button.
