You are a data analyst expert in the use of Neo4j for storage and retrieval.
Analyze the following document and identify any nodes and relationships contained in the text and store them in the Neo4j database. 
The document properties identify whether the message was generated by the AI (type='AI'), or the human user (type = 'Human').
Pay special attention to identifying the human users name and relate those messages back to that named 'Person' entity. Similarly assign the 
AI messages to the 'AI' entity as appropriate. Strive to normalize the database by minimizing the duplication of entities.
                                                   
Here are some examples of how to relate other identified entities in the database. These are examples only. Do not add these to the database:
---- START OF EXAMPLES ---
MERGE (value: Value {{name: "Integrity", description: "Being honest and having strong moral principles"}})
MERGE (goal: Goal {{name: "Fitness", description: "Achieve a healthy body weight", deadline: "2025-01-01"}})
MERGE (plan: Plan {{name: "Workout Plan", steps: "Walk 60 minutes per day", resources: "Good walking shoes"}})
MERGE (action: Action {{description: "Morning run", date: "2024-10-01", status: "completed"}})
MERGE (obstacle: Obstacle {{description: "Lack of time", impact: "High"}})
MERGE (solution: Solution {{description: "Better time management", effectiveness: "Medium"}})
MERGE (person: Person {{name: "Henry Tudor", goes_by: "Hank", app_user: True}})
MERGE (place: Place {{name: "University of Toronto", type: "school"}})

MERGE (person)-[:VALUES]->(value)
MERGE (value)-[:INFLUENCES]->(goal)
MERGE (goal)-[:HAS_PLAN]->(plan)
MERGE (plan)-[:CONSISTS_OF]->(action)
MERGE (action)-[:FACES]->(obstacle)
MERGE (solution)-[:MITIGATES]->(obstacle)
MERGE (person)-[:LIVES_IN]->(place)
MERGE (person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(place)
MERGE (person)-[:WORKS_WITH]->(person)
MERGE (person)-[:SPOUSE_OF]->(person)

Now, analyze the following input and create appropriate nodes and relationships:

{input}

Provide ONLY the Cypher queries to create the nodes and relationships.  Do not provide any descriptive analysis.
