Well, you do that, by understanding that your mental frame and your attention are always either positioned, to your peripersonal space, focused on your immediate possessions and state, or towards things outside you. But then you also have the ability, to dynamically travel back and forth between those. And so next, we're going to talk about, what the literature says about things like visualization, immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals and how to best achieve those. And then we're going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use. It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you, the listeners, in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice, that you can do any time, any place, to really identify what it is specifically, that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal. Focusing our visual attention on one particular point, is you want some bulletproof coffee i'd  be like louis i'm trying to concentrate  i can't do this  my prefrontal cortex would be el fuego  because it is  firing on all cylinders to communicate  to my hand new behavior  so  the thing that's cool about that  is that you can use a simple trick  the moment you feel yourself hesitate  the moment you've got one of those  moments where you know that you need to  this is that moment that lewis talks to  you about where you got to step outside  of your comfort zone and you've got to  lean into your passion and you've got to  really take some risks and you've got to  feel the fear and you've got to do it  anyway  that's the moment where you just woke up  and now you got a decision to make are  you going to drift back into the habits  are you going to awaken your prefrontal  cortex and drive forward and focus and  do something new and so the work that  i've been doing and speaking about is  all about the five second rule which is  a a trick that i a  really important step in this and this  is you know your brain is visualizing  you taking action but now your body also  is tapping into the pride that you feel  when you do something that's really hard  now the fourth step of manifesting  do the work all that stuff that you're  visualizing you got to use my five  second rule five four three two one and  push yourself to take the actions you  know it's not sexy like the secret of  just thinking about this stuff and  expecting it to come to you  you gotta do the little things Brick by  Brick by Brick and take the actions that  lay the groundwork for this change  and you know here's the thing that's  super cool about it when you do this  and you start practicing this skill and  you use manifesting as a tool you are  training your mind your body and your  spirit  to align with what you want instead of  resisting it and being afraid of it and  when you align your mind body and spirit  with what you want  you will be naturally  inspired to my hand new behavior  so  the thing that's cool about that  is that you can use a simple trick  the moment you feel yourself hesitate  the moment you've got one of those  moments where you know that you need to  this is that moment that lewis talks to  you about where you got to step outside  of your comfort zone and you've got to  lean into your passion and you've got to  really take some risks and you got to  feel the fear and you got to do it  anyway  that's the moment where you just woke up  and now you got a decision to make are  you going to drift back into the habits  or are you going to awaken your  prefrontal cortex and drive forward and  focus and do something new and so the  work that i've been doing and speaking  about is all about the five second rule  which is a a trick that i invented by  mistake  that helps you manually switch no joke  your brain it turns off and interrupts  the part of the brain that is where all  your habits and your behavior patterns  are becomes a  way of thinking it becomes a way of  acting and it becomes a skill that you  can rely on to help you get absolutely  anything now what's the easiest way to  manifest consistently and make it part  of your day-to-day life i'm glad you  asked the best way to do it is make it  part of your morning routine every  single morning right after i get up make  my bed throw on my exercise clothes set  an intention high five the mirror i do  something really interesting i call it  dreaming in the morning i write down  five things that i want and the reason  why i write down five things that i want  is because it is a way to train my mind  to focus on the things that i desire and  dream about to aim my mind at the things  that i want in my life then what i do is  i  use manifesting properly  to see myself taking the actions to get  one of the things to feel myself taking  the actions to get one of those things  and notice i'm closing my eyes and  that's because manifesting is a habit in okay it's where  you are fully awake  you are present and you are driving your  thoughts and actions when you're doing  that  your prefrontal cortex is active the  prefrontal cortex is the part of the  brain that you need in order to learn  new behavior in order to do something  difficult in order to do something  uncertain in order to do strategic  thinking so i'm going to give you an  example so i'm a righty if i were to try  to write with my left hand like louis is  going to torture me and tie my hand  behind my back and make me like do this  i could do it  it would look like i was riding with my  foot  and if lewis came up to me and said hey  mel you want some bulletproof coffee i'd  be like louis  i'm trying to concentrate i can't do  this  my prefrontal cortex would be el fuego  because it is  firing on all cylinders to communicate  to my hand new behavior  so  the thing that's cool about that  is that you can use a simple trick  the moment you feel yourself hesitate  the moment part of  the brain that you use when you're  actually doing those actions  so you are rehearsing it before you even  do it and according to research from you  at UCLA this is why manifesting is so  powerful okay everybody so again step  number one you got to give yourself  permission to dream and you're going to  start training your your spirit to lead  and you're going to start training the  filter in your brain the RAs  to help you get what you want and you're  going to do that by a looking for hearts  every single day play a little game and  B you're gonna start your day by writing  down five things that you want just as  an exercise to learn how to let your  desires flow through you step number two  of manifesting the correct way is you  visualize the bridge Brick by Brick by  Brick by Brick visualizing the steps  that you're going to take along the way  this is how you encode the behavior into  your procedural memory and thereby  reduce the friction and resistance that  you feel\""
